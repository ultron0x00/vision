# My Vision

We have to evolve. Thereâ€™s no room for the weak.

You're wondering why you can't find the flag.

Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers. People create... smaller people? Children, designed to supplant them. 

Always remember, "Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which."
